# Dependently Typed Einstein Summation

Implementing a dependently typed Einstein summation in Idris, inspired by Python's [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/).

The main idea is to provide a _typed_ version of [einsum](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.einsum.html).

Work in progress
